Star Formation Rate (SFR) - Dark Matter Halos (DMH) Mass
============================================

This is an study of the relationship between SFR and DMH in galaxies at redshift z~6.

Here I generate a Galaxy Luminosity Function (LF) for DMH. Using the Markov Chain Monte 
Carlo method some parameters are changed to fit that function with observational data.
