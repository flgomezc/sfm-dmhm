%``Fig. 16.— Updated Determinations of the derived SFR (left axis) and U V
%luminosity (right axis) densities versus redshift (5.4). The
%left axis gives the SFR densities we would infer from the measured luminosity
%densities, assuming the Madau et al. (1998) conversion
%factor relevant for star-forming galaxies with ages of 108 yr (see also
%Kennicutt 1998). The right axis gives the U V luminosities we infer
