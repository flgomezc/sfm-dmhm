\section{Observations}

This paper is based on three main observation sets. The most recent is from the
Hubble Space Telescope, this observations where performed by \cite{bouwens14}.
The second set is from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope, \cite{willott13} and
the last one by the UK Infrared Telescope and the Subaru Telescope
\cite{mclure09}.

The data from the HST is a compilation of previous works since
2006 \citep{bouwens06}, wich includes also observations after the 2009
upgrade mission\citep{bouwens12}. CFHTLS observations where made using Lyman
Break Galaxies 

The dataset was retrieved from graphs for \cite{bouwens14} and \cite{mclure09} 
using

  \subsection{CFHTLS}
  
  CFHTLS - Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey - 
MegaCam\citep{willott13}

  ``We identify a sample of 40 Lyman break galaxies brighter than
    magnitude z ′ = 25.3 across an area of almost 4 square degrees. 
    Sensitive spectroscopic observations of seven galaxies provide 
    redshifts for four, of which only two have moderate to strong 
    Lyα emission lines. All four have clear continuum breaks in 
    their spectra.'' \cite{willott13}.

  ``The imaging data used to select high-redshift galax-
    ies come primarily from the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii
    Telescope. Optical observations with MegaCam in the
    u ∗ g ′ r ′ i ′ z ′ filters are from CFHTLS Deep which covered
    four ≈ 1 square degree fields with typical total integra-
    tion time of 75 ks in u ∗ , 85 ks in g ′ , 145 ks in r ′ , 230 ks in
    i ′ and 175 ks in z ′ . The seeing in the final stacks at i ′ and
    z ′ range from 0.66 to 0.76 arcsec. The data used here are
    from the 6th data release, T0006, which contains all the
    data acquired over the five years of the project '' \cite{willott13}.

  ``These optical data are complemented by near-IR data
    from the WIRCam Deep Survey (WIRDS; Bielby et al.
    2012). WIRDS used the WIRCam near-IR imager at
    the CFHT'' \cite{willott13}.

   About the Luminosity function: sect 6.3
   ``Because our LBG sample covers only a limited range of
    apparent and absolute magnitudes, we cannot use it to determine
    the full galaxy luminosity function at z = 6. The luminosity
    function at the break and at fainter magnitudes has already
    been well studied from deep HST surveys over small sky areas
    (Bouwens et al. 2007). The main contribution of our study is
    to determine the space density of very rare, highly luminous
    LBGs.''\cite{willott13}.

  \subsection{UKIDSS \& SDXS}
    ``The UDS is the deepest of five near-IR surveys currently underway
      at the UK InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT) with the new WFCAM
      imager (Casali et al. 2007) which together comprise the UKIDSS
      (Lawrence et al. 2007). The UDS covers an area of 0.8 deg 2 cen-
      tred on RA = 02:17:48, Dec. = −05:05:57 (J2000) and is already
      the deepest, large area, near-IR survey ever undertaken. The data
      utilized in this paper were taken from the first UKIDSS Data Re-
      lease (DR1; Warren et al. 2007), which included JK imaging of the
      entire UDS field to 5σ depths of J = 23.9, K = 23.8 (1.6 arcsec
      diameter apertures). The UKIDSS DR1 became publicly available
      to the world wide astronomical community in 2008 January and can
      be downloaded from the WFCAM Science Archive. 2
      The UDS field is covered by a wide variety of deep, multiwave-
      length observations ranging from the X-ray through to the radio (see
      Cirasuolo et al. 2008 for a recent summary). However, for this study
      the most important multiwavelength observations are the deep op-
      tical imaging of the field taken with Suprime-Cam (Miyazaki et al.
      2002) on Subaru as part of the Subaru/XMM–Newton Deep Survey
      (Sekiguchi et al. 2005). The optical imaging consists of five over-
      lapping Suprime-Cam pointings, and covers an area of 1.3 deg 2 .
      The whole field has been imaged in the BV Ri z filters, to typical
      5σ depths of B = 27.9, V = 27.4, R = 27.2, i = 27.2 and z = 26.2
      (1.6 arcsec diameter apertures). The reduced optical imaging of the
      SXDS is now publicly available 3 and full details of the observations,
      data reduction and calibration procedures are provided in Furusawa
      et al. (2008). The high-redshift galaxies investigated in this study
      were selected from a contiguous area of 0.63 deg 2 (excluding areas
      contaminated by bright stars and CCD blooming) covered by both
      the UDS near-IR and SXDS optical imaging.'' \cite{mclure09}
