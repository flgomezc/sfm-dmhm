\section{Methodology}

The first goal in this paper is reproduce the observed UVLF from DMH, from
 simulations at redshift $z=6$. The observational datasets where aforementioned.

Bolshoi Simulation \citep{riebe13} was performed by the MuldiDark consortium
MultiDark Database is 

UV Luminosity as function of DMH mass. 
Parameters.
Dust Extinction


MCMC, maximum likelihood.

UV luminosity to SFR
