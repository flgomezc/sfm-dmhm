\section{Observations}

This paper is based on three main observational data sets. The most recent is
from the Hubble Space Telescope Legacy plus ground telescopes \citep{bouwens14}.
The second set is from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope\citep{willott13} and
the last one by the UK Infrared Telescope and the Subaru Telescope
\cite{mclure09}. Those observations where made using the Drop-out technique.

The data from the HSTL is a compilation of previous works since
2006 \citep{bouwens06}, wich includes also observations after the 2009
upgrade mission\citep{bouwens12}. They estimate the uncertainty in their LF due
to cosmic variance. Taking account they used five independent surveys, they get
jus $\sigma\sim 10\%$ using the Cosmic Variance Calculator developed by Trenti
\& Stiavelli (2008).

``We estimate that the overall uncertainty in our LF results to
be just 10\%, by using the Trenti \& Stiavelli (2008) cos-
mic variance calculator and considering the observational
constraints we have over 5 independent âˆ¼150 arcmin2
search fields.'' \citep{bouwens14}



The dataset was retrieved from graphs for \cite{bouwens14} and \cite{mclure09}
